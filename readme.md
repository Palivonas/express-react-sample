## Sample React + Express blog app

### Starting server
* Node 8+ required
* `yarn install` (or `npm install`, no lock file though)
* `yarn start`
* Listens on port 3001 or PORT env variable
* API is on `/api`
* `../client/build` is served on `/`

### Starting client
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start` for development
* `yarn build` to serve from API server

### Linting, testing
* `yarn lint` in both `client` and `server`
* `yarn test` in `server` (no client tests yet)
